This decribes the Dev Ex goals for this project.  I acknowledge that this is a work in progress and right now these are aspirational. 



# 🧭 Go API Wrapper Developer Experience Checklist
This checklist is intended to help maintain a **great developer experience (DX)** for Go API wrappers.  
Use it during reviews or before releases to ensure the library feels idiomatic, intuitive, and consistent.

---

## 1️⃣ Setup and Discovery
- [ ] **Single entrypoint:** There’s one obvious way to create a client (`NewClient(...)`).
- [ ] **Minimal friction:** Developers can connect and make their first call in under 3 lines.
- [ ] **Sensible defaults:** Works without manual config for base URL, timeouts, etc.
- [ ] **Functional options:** Configurable via `WithX()` options — no massive structs.
- [ ] **Clear naming:** Functions and types use domain language, not internal API terms.

---

## 2️⃣ API Design and Idiomatic Go
- [ ] **Idiomatic verbs:** Methods use verbs like `GetUser`, `ListUsers`, `CreateUser`.
- [ ] **Context everywhere:** Each request accepts a `context.Context`.
- [ ] **Typed responses:** Returns structs, not `interface{}` or raw maps.
- [ ] **Simple returns:** Follows `(result, error)` — no custom wrappers unless justified.
- [ ] **No panics:** Library never panics under normal use.

---

## 3️⃣ Errors and Resilience
- [ ] **Descriptive errors:** Wrapped with context (e.g. `return fmt.Errorf("get user: %w", err)`).
- [ ] **Typed or sentinel errors:** Allow `errors.Is(err, ErrUnauthorized)` checks.
- [ ] **Helpful messages:** Enough detail to diagnose issues without dumping HTTP payloads.
- [ ] **Retries/backoff:** Optional and safe defaults for transient network failures.
- [ ] **Rate-limit awareness:** Returns retry hints if supported by the API.

---

## 4️⃣ Structs and JSON Models
- [ ] **Exported structs:** Public-facing data types are exported.
- [ ] **Proper JSON tags:** Field names match documented API (`json:"user_id"`).
- [ ] **Optional fields:** Use `omitempty` for nullable or optional values.
- [ ] **Stable contracts:** Avoid renaming/removing fields across versions.
- [ ] **Minimal magic:** Prefer standard `json.Unmarshal` over custom logic unless needed.

---

## 5️⃣ Developer Feedback and Debugging
- [ ] **Debug mode:** Optional logging for requests and responses.
- [ ] **Clear error boundaries:** Distinguish between network and API errors.
- [ ] **Helpful error data:** Includes status code, endpoint, and relevant message.
- [ ] **Instrumentation hooks:** Optional metrics or event callbacks for observability.

---

## 6️⃣ Testing and Mockability
- [ ] **Interface-based:** Core client implements a simple `API` interface.
- [ ] **Mocks or fakes:** Easy to stub out for unit tests.
- [ ] **No globals:** Avoid shared mutable state or side effects.
- [ ] **Custom HTTP client:** Supports user-supplied `*http.Client` for testing.
- [ ] **Robust tests:** Unit tests use `httptest.Server` to simulate API behavior.

---

## 7️⃣ Documentation and Examples
- [ ] **Godoc coverage:** Every exported symbol has a meaningful doc comment.
- [ ] **Runnable examples:** In `example_test.go` and verified via `go test`.
- [ ] **README coverage:** Includes setup, authentication, and first call.
- [ ] **Error-handling examples:** Show checking specific error types.
- [ ] **Versioning clarity:** Communicates breaking changes or compatibility guarantees.

---

## 8️⃣ Developer Delight (Bonus Points)
- [ ] Pagination helpers or iterators instead of manual cursor loops.
- [ ] Convenience one-liners (`client.MustGetUser(id)` for CLI tools).
- [ ] Consistent timeout and cancellation handling.
- [ ] Graceful handling of context cancellations.
- [ ] Helpful `String()` methods for logging.

---

### ✅ Final DX Test
> Ask a new developer to use the wrapper for 10 minutes *without reading the docs.*  
> - Could they figure it out from naming and autocomplete alone?  
> - If yes → you’ve nailed it.

---

**Tip:** Treat the wrapper like a product.  
The better it *feels* to use, the more developers will trust and adopt it.
