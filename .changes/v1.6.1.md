## v1.6.1 - 2026-02-20
### Added
* Added type for the response to deleting an instance rather than risk confusion with use of GetInstanceResponse. 
* validates instance / tenant id in instances / tenants service before making API call
### Changed
* Split out types from services.  Now have <service name>_service.go and <service name>_types.go 
* ensureValidToken has been modified to avoid a potential race condition
* Added context for all calls so that in-flight calls can be cancelled or trace attached. Previously only one context was used, not per function call. 
* Updated test files to use context with each function call
### Fixed
* the WithTimeout call happens exactly once per user-initiated operation
* Updated examples to use context in function calls
