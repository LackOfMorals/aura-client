## v2.0.0 - 2026-02-10
### Changed
* type name will be used as aura.AuraAPIClient by other packages, and that stutters; renamed to APIClient ( linting )
* api.APIResponse,api.APIError, api.APIErrorDetail and api.RequestService all have API removed to prevent stutters ( message from linting ) 
* Moved away from home grown prometheus metrics client to use the prometheus client go package
### Removed
* Store service removed from core client as this should be an application responsibility.
This change keeps the API client lightweight and focused on a single domain.

### Fixed
* Potential race condition - Auth token could expire between RUnlock and Lock
* Add validation for instance overwrite to make sure that at least ONE source is provided
